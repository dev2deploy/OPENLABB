@@An opensource (premised) development lab for localized testing of modernizing, emergent technologies.@@

The repository is mostly focused on a modest kubernetes cluster with one control plane/node running all of our self hosted services and storage,
but it also serves as the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for an entire homelab network and devices, to include: a VyOS gateway/firewall,
a couple of workstations, wireless devices, and a Ubiquiti Unifi switch.
Ultimately, this will include all applications for managing home IT systems.

# üçá Cluster

## Infrastructure Automation

Host buildout is handled by [Ansible][ansible-uri] automation.
The whole lab is built out from a [top level playbook](./homelab.yml), with segment specific playbooks under the [`playbooks/`](./playbooks/) directory.
(As a convention, all Ansible yaml files are suffixed `.yml` to allow VSCode to distinguish between those and all other yaml files.)
The full task list can be found in the [infrastructure](./infrastructure/README.md) folder, but as an overview, it will:

- Install system packages and any other necessary system related setup
- Pull down cluster images and binaries
- Install container runtime and start kubelet
- Run `kubeadm` to setup to create cluster
- Creates a separate user to continue setting up the cluster with to get away from using the admin credentials
- Applies CNI configuration
- Generates Application files for every cluster app and drops them into [`cluster/bootstrap`](./cluster/bootstrap) and Kustomization files into[`cluster/apps`](./cluster/apps) for the respective apps
- Bootstraps the cluster by starting ArgoCD and then applying [`cluster/cluster.yaml`](./cluster/cluster.yaml)

## GitOps

[ArgoCD][argocd-uri] watches all subfolders under the [`cluster`](./cluster) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

The way Argo works for me here is (almost) every file in the [`cluster/bootstrap`](./cluster/bootstrap) directory will define an `argoproj.io/v1alpha1/Application` that points to a corresponding folder under [`cluster/apps`](./cluster/apps).
The `Application` will apply any manifest files it finds in that directory,
in addition to any Helm Charts or Kustomizations [that may also be defined](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/) within the `Application`'s spec.
One or more Helm `values.yaml` files are in each directory and each helm definition in the `Application` refers to the specific values file to apply to that chart.

## Directories

This Git repository contains the following top level directories.
